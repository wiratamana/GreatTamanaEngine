# Event handling

_Part of [GreatTamanaEngine](../../README.md)'s architecture docs. See
[docs/README.md](../README.md) for the full documentation index._

SDL's raw event stream never reaches `Game` (or anything else past
`Application`) directly. Each frame, `Application::Run()` polls SDL and turns
every event into the engine's own vocabulary before anything else sees it:

```
SDL_Event -> EventTranslator -> gte::Event -> InputState.Apply() + Game::OnEvent()
                                                                 \-> Game::Update(dt, InputState)
```

- **`EventTranslator`** (`src/Application/EventTranslator.h/.cpp`) is the only
  other place besides `Application` itself allowed to touch `SDL_Event`. It
  translates each raw SDL event into `gte::Event` (`src/Event/Event.h`), using
  engine-owned `KeyCode`/`MouseButton` enums instead of SDL's — so nothing
  past this point ever needs to know SDL exists.
- **`InputState`** (`src/Input/InputState.h/.cpp`) tracks continuous,
  queryable input state (held keys/buttons, mouse position/delta), built up
  by applying translated events. It's passed into `Game::Update()` for
  polling-style input, e.g. `input.IsKeyDown(KeyCode::W)` for movement while a
  key is held.
- **`Game::OnEvent(const Event&)`** is called once per translated event, for
  discrete/one-shot reactions (window resized, a key just pressed, quit) —
  as opposed to the continuous polling done via `InputState` in `Update()`.
