Instructions for LLM/AI agents working on this codebase.

## Coding Guidelines

- **Clean Architecture**: Write clean architecture code. Keep clear
  separation of concerns between layers (e.g. SDL -> Application -> Window
  and Renderer -> Game). Lower-level/core layers must not depend on
  higher-level or framework-specific details. Only the `Application` layer
  should know about SDL directly; other layers must go through the custom
  abstraction objects (Window, Renderer, etc.).
- **RAII**: Every resource-owning piece of code must use RAII (Resource
  Acquisition Is Initialization). Resources (SDL handles, memory, file
  handles, GPU objects, etc.) must be acquired in constructors and released
  in destructors, so lifetime is tied to object scope and cleanup is
  automatic and exception/error-safe. Avoid manual/explicit cleanup calls
  scattered through the code — wrap raw resources in owning types instead.

This document will be extended as more conventions are established.
